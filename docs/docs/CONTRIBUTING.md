# Contributing to Canvico Editor

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Canvico Editor! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This is one of the best ways to contribute. A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please be as detailed as possible when creating an issue. Include your operating system, browser version, and steps to reproduce the bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on our repository and describe your suggestion. Provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine.
3.  **Create a branch** for your new feature (`git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature`).
4.  **Commit** your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to the project's coding standards.
5.  **Push** your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature`).
6.  **Open a pull request** to the `develop` branch in the original repo.

Please note that only the repository owner can merge pull requests and publish new versions. Your contribution will be reviewed, and once approved, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.
